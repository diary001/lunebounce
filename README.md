# lunebounce
This is the first theme for Moonbounce! I spent a few months working on this to make sure everything was perfected. This theme was created solely by me, so please do not message the Moonbonuce team for support.
For any questions please join the Moonbounce Elites Discord server: https://discord.gg/mbe

# FAQ
## How do I modify the theme?
I don't currently suggest modifying the theme. I will not offer support if you attempt to customize the theme and it breaks.
I will create a customization guide at some point in the future.

## I just updated Moonbounce. Why is the theme broken?
I get updates at the same time as everyone else. I need time to add styles to the new and updated elements.

## How do I report a bug, or report something not being themed properly?
Please create a support ticket in the #support channel.
