# lunebounce
This is the first theme for Moonbounce! I spent a few months working on this to make sure everything was perfected. This theme was created solely by me, so please do not message the Moonbonuce team for support.

# FAQ
## How do I modify the theme?
I dont currently suggest modifying the theme as you might break something and I will not offer support if you attempt to customize the theme and break.
I will create a customization guide at some point in the future.

## I just updated Moonbounce. Why is the theme broken?
I get updates at the same time as everyone else. I need time to add styles to the new and updated elements.

## How do I report a bug, or report something not being themed properly?
Please create a support ticket in the #support channel.
